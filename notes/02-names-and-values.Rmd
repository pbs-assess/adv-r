- copy-on-modify modify behaviour is important

- Trace copy-on-modify behaviour: 
- `tracemem()`
- `untracemem()`

- Lists: more complex because instead of storing the values itself, it instead stores references to them

- "This, however, is a shallow copy: the list object and its bindings are copied, but the values pointed to by the bindings are not."

- To see values that are shared across lists, use `lobstr::ref()`

- Data frames are lists of vectors

- Character vectors are strange! "But this is a polite fiction. R actually uses a global string pool where each element of a character vector is a pointer to a unique string in the pool:"

- find out how much memory object takes with `lobstr::obj_size()`

- "because R uses a global string pool character vectors take up less memory than you might expect"

- "obj_size(x) + obj_size(y) will only equal obj_size(x, y) if there are no shared values."

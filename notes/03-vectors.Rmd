- "Vectors come in two flavours: atomic vectors and lists11. They differ in terms of their elements’ types: for atomic vectors, all elements must have the same type; for lists, elements can have different types"

- "When the inputs are atomic vectors, c() always creates another atomic vector; i.e. it flattens:"

- see typeof()!

```r
x <- c(NA, 5, NA, 10)
x == NA
#> [1] NA NA NA NA
```

- "This result is correct (if a little surprising) because there’s no reason to believe that one missing value has the same value as another.

- "Technically there are four missing values, one for each of the atomic types: NA (logical), NA_integer_ (integer), NA_real_ (double), and NA_character_ (character)."

-  "one" > 2; [1] TRUE

- "There are only two attributes that are routinely preserved: 1: names, a character vector giving each element a name. 2: dim, short for dimensions, an integer vector, used to turn vectors into matrices or arrays."

- "You can remove names from a vector by using unname(x) or names(x) <- NULL."

- "To be useful with character subsetting (e.g. Section 4.5.1) names should be unique, and non-missing, but this is not enforced by R."

- see `abind::abind()` and `dimnames()` for working with arrays

- "Factors are built on top of an integer vector with two attributes: a class, “factor”, which makes it behave differently from regular integer vectors, and levels, which defines the set of allowed values."

- "POSIXct vectors are built on top of double vectors, where the value represents the number of seconds since 1970-01-01."

-  the elements of a list are references

- "Technically speaking, each element of a list is actually the same type because, as you saw in Section 2.3.3, each element is really a reference to another object, which can be any type."

- list matrices!

```r
l <- list(1:3, "a", TRUE, 1.0)
dim(l) <- c(2, 2)
l
#>      [,1]      [,2]
#> [1,] Integer,3 TRUE
#> [2,] "a"       1

l[[1, 1]]
#> [1] 1 2 3
```

- "A data frame is a named list of vectors with attributes for (column) names, row.names20, and its class, “data.frame”"

- "In contrast to a regular list, a data frame has an additional constraint: the length of each of its vectors must be the same."

- "The length() of a data frame gives the number of columns."

- "A concise, and fun, way to summarise the main differences is that tibbles are lazy and surly: they do less and complain more"

- see tibble::rownames_to_column()

- for data frames, "it’s not the length() of each column that must be equal, but the NROW().)"

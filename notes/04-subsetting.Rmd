"Subsetting with nothing can be useful with assignment because it preserves the structure of the original object."

```r
mtcars[] <- lapply(mtcars, as.integer)
is.data.frame(mtcars)
#> [1] TRUE

mtcars <- lapply(mtcars, as.integer)
is.data.frame(mtcars)
#> [1] FALSE
```


Character matching is a powerful way to create lookup tables. Say you want to convert abbreviations:

```r
x <- c("m", "f", "u", "f", "f", "m", "m")
lookup <- c(m = "Male", f = "Female", u = NA)
lookup[x]
#>        m        f        u        f        f        m        m
#>   "Male" "Female"       NA "Female" "Female"   "Male"   "Male"

unname(lookup[x])
```

```r
grades <- c(1, 2, 2, 3, 1)

info <- data.frame(
  grade = 3:1,
  desc = c("Excellent", "Good", "Poor"),
  fail = c(F, F, T)
)

id <- match(grades, info$grade)
id
#> [1] 3 2 2 1 3
info[id, ]
#>     grade      desc  fail
#> 3       1      Poor  TRUE
#> 2       2      Good FALSE
#> 2.1     2      Good FALSE
#> 1       3 Excellent FALSE
#> 3.1     1      Poor  TRUE
```

"If you’re matching on multiple columns, you’ll need to first collapse them into a single column (with e.g. interaction()). Typically, however, you’re better off switching to a function designed specifically for joining multiple tables like merge(), or dplyr::left_join()."

```r
df <- data.frame(x = c(2, 4, 1), y = c(9, 11, 6), n = c(3, 5, 1))
rep(1:nrow(df), df$n)
#> [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 3

df[rep(1:nrow(df), df$n), ]
#>     x  y n
#> 1   2  9 3
#> 1.1 2  9 3
#> 1.2 2  9 3
#> 2   4 11 5
#> 2.1 4 11 5
#> 2.2 4 11 5
#> 2.3 4 11 5
#> 2.4 4 11 5
#> 3   1  6 1
```

"And don’t forget De Morgan’s laws, which can be useful to simplify negations:

!(X & Y) is the same as !X | !Y
!(X | Y) is the same as !X & !Y

For example, !(X & !(Y | Z)) simplifies to !X | !!(Y|Z), and then to !X | Y | Z."

"x[-which(y)] is not equivalent to x[!y]: if y is all FALSE, which(y) will be integer(0) and -integer(0) is still integer(0), so you’ll get no values, instead of all values."
